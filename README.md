# scheme-flavored-JS
JavaScript was heavily influenced by [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)), a language in the [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) family. What would it look like if we kept turning up the Scheme dial?

This means:
* using primitives like `car` and `cdr` (which I'll call `first` and `rest` for semantic purposes)
* avoiding the use of statements (since lisps are trees of expressions)
* using recursion
